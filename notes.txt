The motion of a particle can be defined using piecewise functions
If the function is elementary, it can be translated to represent kinematic attributes of the function 
   The result will be an arbitrary polynomial

If the function is transcendental, however there may or may not be a proper translation to physical attributes.
   I still need to convince myself of this
   I believe it may be true, since one can arbitrarily change the physical constants of a particle to follow
   any arbitrary path.
   Whether these "arbitrary" changes can be mapped to specific transcendental functions is unknown to me
   If I can at least find a mapping to trigonometric functions, then I may be satsified with just that

The purpose of defining a relationship between mathematical functions and physical attributes is to make particle systems
mathematically defined as well.
